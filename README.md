# Ruby2D

I created this repository to go through Ruby2D's documentation for usage in upcoming projects.

You can find the link here: `https://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/`

## Instalation

First, you need to install the gem in your machine:

```
gem install ruby2d
```

## Usage

Once you create a program, you need to require it as follows:

```
require 'ruby2d'
show
```

## Contents

I plan to cover the following subjects in separate files within this project:

```
Window
2D Basics
Colors
Shapes
Images
Sprites
Tilesets
Text
Audio
Input
Console
```
